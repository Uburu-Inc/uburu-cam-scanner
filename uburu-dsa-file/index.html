        <p>
          Any dispute between the Parties in respect of any matter arising out
          of this Agreement or its interpretation on their respective rights,
          duties and obligations shall be resolved between the Parties amicably
          within 21 days, failing which the dispute shall be referred to
          Mediation at the Lagos Multi-Door Courthouse (LMDC) for resolution

        <h4>GENERAL PROVISIONS</h4>

        <p>
          a) Breach or Violation. The Provider is not responsible for the
          Recipient’s violations of the NHA Privacy Rules unless the Provider
          knows of a pattern of activity or practice that constitutes a material
          breach or violation of the NHA privacy rules. Where a liability arises
          due to any data breach occasioned by a Recipient’s access by Uburu,
          such liability shall be borne by Uburu. Parties shall however
          determine the extent of the data breach and agree on mitigating
          strategies which shall collectively be in the continued best interest
          of the Provider and Uburu.
        </p>

        <p>
          b) Warranties. The Provider warrants that (i) it is approved by the
          appropriate health regulatory body to provide health-related services;
          (ii) it is licensed or registered in its state of operation; (iii) as
          of the date of this Agreement, it is not excluded, debarred or
          otherwise ineligible to participate in rendering health-related
          services; or (iv) it has not been convicted of a criminal offense
          related to the provision of health-related services that could lead to
          debarment or exclusion. The Provider agrees to immediately notify
          Recipient in the event the foregoing representation and warranty are
          no longer completely accurate.
        </p>

        <p>
          c) Review and Amendment. This Agreement shall be reviewed and amended
          from time to time as is necessary for the Provider to comply with the
          requirements of the NHA.
        </p>

        <p>
          d) Survival. The respective rights and obligations of the Recipient
          shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
        </p>

        <p>
          e) Indemnity. Recipient shall indemnify and hold harmless Provider and
          its officers, trustees, employees, and agents from any claims,
          penalties, fines, costs, liabilities, or damages, including but not
          limited to reasonable attorney fees, incurred by Provider arising from
          a violation of Recipient’s obligations under this Agreement.
        </p>

        <p>
          f) Injunctive Relief. Recipient stipulates that its unauthorized use
          or disclosure of the Protected Health Information would cause
          irreparable harm to the Provider, and in such an event, Provider shall
          be entitled to institute proceedings in any court of competent
          jurisdiction to obtain damages and injunctive relief.
        </p>

        <p>g) Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned.</p>

        <p>
          h) Authorized Signers. As applicable, Provider warrants and represents
          that it is authorized to execute this Agreement on behalf of all
          Practices participating with the Provider.
