        </p>

        <p>

          its obligations under this Agreement;
        </p>

        <p>
          b) Where PROVIDER does not have/use a local or cloud database or
          voluntarily declines access to their local or cloud database, PROVIDER
          shall only be eligible to participate in patient record exchange

          infrastructure platform;
        </p>
        <p>

          third-party IT vendor is changed;
        </p>

          of data from their database to meet Recipients requests in projects;
        </p>

        <p>
          vi. That advanced data processing methods such as tokenization and
          encryption may be utilized to support cybersecurity and precision in

        <p>
          d) Ensure measures to prevent any undue interference, manipulation,
          coercion of PROVIDER’s staff during data upload or download in
          furtherance of the Project;

        <p>
          e) Ensure that the information uploaded is correct, complete, and
          up-to-date as required for the purpose for which it is being shared.
          Without this, any decision made on the information may be flawed, and
          inappropriate actions may result. If PROVIDER is aware of a material
          inaccuracy or omission in the information, PROVIDER must inform Uburu
          of that inaccuracy or omission;
        </p>

        <p>
